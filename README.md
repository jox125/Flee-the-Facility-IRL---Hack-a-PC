# Flee-the-Facility-IRL---Hack-a-PC

Small javascript game to play Flee the Faciliti IRL. 

To play Flee the Facility IRL, you should spread out several PCs in a larger building,
run the game in full screen on each PC, from the address https://game.sydamegalooming.ee 
Or you can also download the source code and host it locally. 

The principle of the game is that the player must press the E key at the right time 
to pass the so-called skill check, if the skill check is passed three times, 
the computer is hacked (the screen turns green), if the skill check is failed, 
the computer locks for 1 minute and the player must start over
